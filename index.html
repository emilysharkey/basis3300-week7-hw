    <h1> Student Lifestyles Survey </h1>
   
   <p>
    Welcome to our survey on undergraduate student lifestyles! We appreciate your participation in this study, which aims to gather important information about your daily routines,
    habits, and health-realted behaviors. By answering the questions in this survey, you will help us better understand the diverse lifestyles of undergraduate students, and identify areas
    where we can improve their well-being. Your participation is voluntary and all responses will be kept confidential. We estimate that the survey will take approximately 10-15 minutes to 
    complete. Thank you for your time and contribution to this important research!
