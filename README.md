Web Forms

Description of the Project: Created a web form (survey) to collect data about undergraduate student lifestyles. Page one includes about me questions and page two includes questions about lifestyle.

How my web form conforms to best practices: My web form conforms to several best practices for creating a user-freindly survey. First, the survey questions that I wrote are clear and easy to understand for respondents. They use simple language and avoud complex sentence structures that might be confusing. This helps to ensure that users understand the questions and can provide accurate responses. 

Second, the use of dropdown menus and checkboxes for some of my survey questions will help simplify the survey-taking process and make it easier for respondents to complete. This helps reduce the risk of respondents getting frusturated while completing the survey and leading to inaccurate data.

Third, including a "need help" link on certain questions of my survey can be useful for respondents who are not familiar with concepts. By providing a clear guide can ensure the respondents understand the question and can provide accurate responses. Overall, my web form follows several best practicces that has the potential to generate high quality data.
